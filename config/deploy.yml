# Kamal deployment configuration for LocalMind
# Documentation: https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/configuration/
#
# Deployment: Just run `kamal deploy` - it handles both frontend and backend!
#
# The pre-deploy hook (.kamal/hooks/pre-deploy) automatically:
#   1. Builds the backend Docker image
#   2. Pushes it to the registry
#   3. Deploys and restarts the backend container
#   4. Waits for health check
#   5. Then Kamal deploys the frontend
#
# Quick Start:
#   1. Copy .env.example to .env and configure your values
#   2. Copy .kamal/secrets.example to .kamal/secrets
#   3. Run: kamal setup (first time) or kamal deploy (updates)
