description: Create a git commit with a well-structured message
---

Create a git commit for the staged changes. Follow these steps:

1. First, gather information about the current state:
   - Git status: !`git status --short`
   - Staged changes: !`git diff --cached --stat`
   - Recent commits for style reference: !`git log --oneline -5`

2. If there are no staged changes, check for unstaged changes and suggest staging relevant files.

3. Analyze the changes and create a commit message following these guidelines:
   - Start with a type prefix: feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore
   - Keep the first line under 72 characters
   - Add a blank line after the subject if body is needed
   - Use bullet points for multiple changes
   - Focus on the "why" not just the "what"

4. Create the commit using a HEREDOC for proper formatting:
   ```
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   type: Subject line here

   - Detail 1
   - Detail 2
   EOF
   )"
   ```

5. After committing, show the result with `git status` to confirm success.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT include "Generated by Claude" or "Co-Authored-By" sections in the commit message.
